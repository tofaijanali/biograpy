          <h2>Braviest Man of the world</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Ali ibn Abi Talib</b><i> Ali was born in Mecca to Abu Talib ibn Abd al-Muttalib and his wife Fatima bint Asad 
            around 600 CE. His date of birth is possibly 13 Rajab, which is the occasion celebrated annually by Shia Muslims.
             Ali may have been the only person born inside Ka'ba, the holiest site of Islam, which is located in Mecca. However,
             this is disputed by Sunni sources, which state Hakim ibn Hizam was also born in the Ka'ba.
              Furthermore, Sunni scholar Al-Nawawi regards the birth of Ali in the Ka'ba as weak.
              Ali's father was a leading member of the Banu Hashim, a clan within the Meccan tribe of Quraysh.
              Abu Talib also raised his nephew Muhammad after his parents died. Later when Abu Talib fell into poverty,
             Ali was taken in at the age of about five and raised by Muhammad and his wife.</i>

          <h3>Biographies</h3>

            <li>
              <strong>  Ali played a pivotal role in the early years of Islam when Muslims were severely persecuted in Mecca.
            <li>
                The caliphate of Ali was characterized by his strict justice.He implemented radical policies to restore his vision of prophetic governance,
                 and dismissed nearly all of Uthman's governors.
            </li>
            <li>
                As evident from his public speeches,
                 Ali viewed himself not only as the temporal leader of the Muslim community but also as its exclusive religious authority.
            </li>
            <li>
                Ali opposed centralized control over provincial revenues. He equally distributed excess taxes and booty among Muslims,
                 following the precedent of Muhammad and Abu Bakr.
            </li>
            <li>
                During the Muslim civil war, Ali forbade his soldiers from looting, and instead paid them from tax revenues.
                 He also pardoned his enemies in victory.
            </li>
            <li>
                Aisha publicly campaigned against Ali immediately after his accession.
                 She was joined in Mecca by her close relatives,
                 Talha and Zubayr,who thus broke their earlier oaths of allegiance to Ali.
            </li>
            <li>
                The battle took place in December 656.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mu'awiya, the incumbent governor of Syria,
                 was deemed corrupt and unfit by Ali, who wrote to and removed him from his post.</strong>
